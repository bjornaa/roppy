Data for roppy examples
=======================

The examples should be modified to suit the ROMS dataset at hand.
However, to run the examples as they are, certain data are needed.
As the main data file is rather large it is kept outside version 
control.

The example data files should be downloaded and gunzipped
(if necessary) into this directory (``examples/data``)

The main ROMS average file used in almost all examples is
available as::

  ftp://ftp.imr.no/bjorn/roppy/ocean_avg_examples.nc.gz

The size in 94 577 488 bytes (after ``gunzip``)

About the data set
------------------

The file ``ocean_avg_example.nc.gz`` is a gzipped version of a ROMS average file.
The file is produced by a slightly old ROMS version used for regional
climate downscaling for the North Sea. The run is documented in the
paper:

B. Ã…dlandsvik and M. Bentsen, 2007, *Downscaling a 20th century
global climate simulation to the North Sea*, Ocean Dyn., 57, 453-466.


Coast data set
--------------

The lat/lon coast line, ``coast.dat``, can be generated by the python
script ``examples/makecoast.py``. This requires ``cartopy`.

If you don't have ``cartopy`` installed, the data can be downloaded from the ftp site:: 

  ftp://ftp.imr.no/bjorn/roppy/coast.dat

The data are extracted from the ``GSHHS`` dataset, 
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhs/index.html) with intermediate
resolution, limited by -12 < longitude < 16 and   47 < latitude < 66.
