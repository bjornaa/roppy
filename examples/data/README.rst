This directory should contain example data files for the roppy
examples to work. Due to their size, they are kept outside the
version control.

The data files can be downloaded from 
http://code.google.com/p/roppy/downloads

The files should be gunzipped and moved into this directory 
(examples/data).

Data files:
ocean_avg_example.nc   94 577 488 bytes (uncompressed)

Download:
wget -O ocean_avg_example.nc 


wget http://roppy.googlecode.com/files/ocean_avg_example.nc.gz
gunzip ocean_avg_example.nc.gz

About the data set
------------------

ocean_avg_example.nc.gz is a gzipped version of a ROMS average file.
The file is produced by a slightly old ROMS version used for regional
climate downscaling for the North Sea. The run is documented in the
paper: B. Ã…dlandsvik and M. Bentsen, 2007, Downscaling a 20th century
global climate simulation to the North Sea, Ocean Dyn., 57, 453-466.


Coast data set
--------------

The lat/lon coast line, coast.dat, can be generated by the python
script examples/makecoast.py. This requires basemap.

If you don't have basemap, it can be downloaded from google drive by
the command

wget -O coast.dat "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B07Tm4IHL_fDdXRkdTE5RlJhNzg"

The data are extracted from the GSHHS dataset, 
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhs/index.html) intermediate
resolution, limited by -12 < longitude < 16 and   47 < latitude < 66.
 
[TODO: Find a better solution for the data storage]
